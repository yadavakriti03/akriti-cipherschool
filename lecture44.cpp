asymptotic analysis used 
Asymptotic notation is a way to describe the running time or space complexity of an algorithm based on the input size. It is commonly used in complexity analysis to describe how an algorithm performs as the size of the input grows. The three most commonly used notations are Big O, Omega, and Theta.

n2 is more efficient 


Big O notation (O): This notation provides an upper bound on the growth rate of an algorithm’s running time or space usage. It represents the worst-case scenario, i.e., the maximum amount of time or space an algorithm may need to solve a problem. For example, if an algorithm’s running time is O(n), then it means that the running time of the algorithm increases linearly with the input size n or less.
f(n)≤c.g(n) for all n≥no


Omega notation (?): This notation provides a lower bound on the growth rate of an algorithm’s running time or space usage. It represents the best-case scenario, i.e., the minimum amount of time or space an algorithm may need to solve a problem. For example, if an algorithm’s running time is ?(n), then it means that the running time of the algorithm increases linearly with the input size n or more.
f(n)>=c.g(n) for all n≥no and c>0

Theta notation (?):
This notation provides both an upper and lower bound on the growth rate of an algorithm’s running time or space usage.It represents the average - case scenario, i.e., the amount of time or space an algorithm typically needs to solve a problem.For example, if an algorithm’s running time is ? (n), then it means that the running time of the algorithm increases linearly with the input size n.c1.g(n) <= f(n) <= c2.g(n)
