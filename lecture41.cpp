//  Algorithm analysis is an important part of computational complexity theory, which provides theoretical estimation for the required resources of an algorithm to solve a specific computational problem. Analysis of algorithms is the determination of the amount of time and space resources required to execute it.
//  To predict the behavior of an algorithm without implementing it on a specific computer.
//  It is much more convenient to have simple measures for the efficiency of an algorithm than to implement the algorithm and test the efficiency every time a certain parameter in the underlying computer system changes.
//  It is impossible to predict the exact behavior of an algorithm. There are too many influencing factors.
//  The analysis is thus only an approximation; it is not perfect.
//  More importantly, by analyzing different algorithms, we can compare them to determine the best one for our purpose.

// we can compare based on no of lines of codes
