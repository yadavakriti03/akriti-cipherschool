//greedy approach   : focusing on that particular instant to find the right solution independent of what happens after
A greedy algorithm is an algorithmic paradigm that follows the problem solving heuristic of making locally optimal choices at each stage with the hope of finding a global optimum. In other words, it is a method for solving an optimization problem by always choosing the best immediate option, without regard for future consequences.

eg :-to cover maximum no of places 
               |
going to the nearest places to the current location
they are often intuitive easy to understand and easy to mimplement 
greedy solution is not necessarily best bcoz it not solve every problem
