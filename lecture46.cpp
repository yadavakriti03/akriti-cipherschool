    // Applications of Greedy Algorithm
    There are many applications of the greedy method in DAA.Some important greedy algorithm applications are :

    Assigning tasks to resources to minimize waiting time
    or maximize efficiency.Selecting the most valuable items to fit into a knapsack with limited capacity.Dividing an image into regions with similar characteristics.Reducing the size of data by removing redundant information

           // Disadvantages/Limitations of Using a Greedy Algorithm
           Below are some disadvantages of the Greedy Algorithm :

    Greedy algorithms may not always find the best possible solution.The order in which the elements are considered can significantly impact the outcome.Greedy algorithms focus on local optimizations
           and may miss better solutions that require considering a broader context.Greedy algorithms are not applicable to problems where the greedy choice does not lead to an optimal solution.
