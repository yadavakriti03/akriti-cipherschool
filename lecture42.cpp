// types of analysis algo
// best case /worst case /avg case
// Best case: Define the input for which algorithm takes less time or minimum time. In the best case calculate the lower bound of an algorithm. Example: In the linear search when search data is present at the first location of large data then the best case occurs.
// Worst Case: Define the input for which algorithm takes a long time or maximum time. In the worst calculate the upper bound of an algorithm. Example: In the linear search when search data is not present at all then the worst case occurs.
// Average case: In the average case take all random inputs and calculate the computation time for all inputs.
// And then we divide it by the total number of inputs.
